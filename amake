#      if  you use a Desktop Environment like Gnome or KDE) after you install
#      the Arduno IDE from the Official site.
#  3 - Do a general search in the $HOME of the user, 1st drawback: if you have
#      multiple folders with installs of the Arduino IDE the pick will be at
#      random (work with headless Linux boxes, aka: no DE)
#  4 - Manual mode: use the path you set in the file $HOME/.amake
